===========================
2012.12.18 Craig
Sawdust (sawdustParticles) moved up so they are visible in game window (for DG).
Results overlay (mResultsOverlay) moved inward so player can click directly
 on the Start or Level button without clicking to clear the Results Overlay first.
 It is still possible to click to clear the Results Overlay, but Start and Level
 buttons also clear it to save a mouse click.

Rank attribute now has the 'editable' property to allow editing of values in DG.

===========================
2012.11.15 Craig
Added "Score" and "Rank" game attributes for DG.
Rank is empty and expected to be edited by the user.
Score is empty and expected to be a user-defined formula attribute.
End of game display rearranged to show "Score", initially "?", 
but if the user-defined formula attribute exists, EndGame()
gets it using the DG 'requestAttributeValues' API.
