Rock Roll [Flash]

Newer entries first.

===========================
2013.03.13 Craig
Debug the DG game interface for RockRoll.  
There are bugs in the order of sending game and event data; 
I added log statements to make these bugs more clear, but have 
not yet fixed them, so this is a work in progress.  I think the
main issue is that event data is sent after a game event is closed.

===========================
2012.10.22
Data is now sent after the roll animation completes.
